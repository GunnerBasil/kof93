# KOF93

Ripped by Basil

KOF93 is a game on windows93.net. My and my friend loved this game, and even though it was super simple, we played it over and over and over again.

Here are the files that I ripped from the website. Use them however you like. If a required file doesn't load (a red color in the Chrome dev tools network tab), just make an issue, and I'll add said file to the repo.

The controls are listed in index.html, but you can view them here:

```
## special moves ##

  # gief #
  fireball    ↓↘→ Q 
  tatsu       ↓↙← Q 

  # honda #

  honda-press ↓2sec ↑ SPACE  

  # dash invincible #
